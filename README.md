Clock based on Waveshare 3.52inch e-Paper HAT, 360 Ã— 240. :leaves: Eco-Friendly!

The clock runs on a 6000mAh LiFePO4 cell ( :leaves: :leaves: Eco-Friendly af!). There is an RTC for super power saving operation, and everyday at a particular time it connects to NTP and updates itself. 

Also, it houses a LUX sensor (BH1750) for sleeping while it is dark (E-paper doesn't have a backlight, remember?) ( :leaves: :leaves: :leaves: Eco-Friendly af faka fak!)

Made of old delivery card boards. :exploding_head: One-Punch Eco-Friendly Boost Ultra Pro Max :leaves: to :infinity:

Supports 5V 1A charging with options upto 2A.

All USB-C operation.

This clock does not runs on GxEPD2 Library (while making this clock, this display was not supported). This runs on OEM provided basic library.

Battery life: <br>
