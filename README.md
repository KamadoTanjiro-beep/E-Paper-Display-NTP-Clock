# Minimalistic E-Paper Display NTP-RTC Clock

Clock based on 3.52inch e-Paper HAT, 360 Ã— 240.

The clock runs on a 6000mAh LiFePO4 cell. There is an RTC for super power saving operation, everyday at a particular time it connects to NTP and updates itself.

Also, it houses a LUX sensor (BH1750) for sleeping while it is dark (E-paper doesn't have a backlight, remember?)

Supports 5V 1A charging with options upto 2A.

All USB-C operation.
